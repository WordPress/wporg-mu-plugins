# Global Header

## Register as a block (for Full Site Editing themes)

1. See `../../../README.md` for installation prerequsites.
1. `require_once .../global-header-footer/blocks.php` file. See `wporg-news-2021` as an example.

## Include directly in PHP (for classic themes)

The same as above, but include `universal-header.php` directly. See `{ todo }` as an example.

## Embed as an iframe (for non-WP software like Trac, Codex, etc)

```
todo add example, maybe w/ something like `src=http...?embed_context=codex`
```
